Sales Data Analysis

Overview:
This project explores Walmart sales data to understand branch performance, popular products, and customer behaviour. The dataset is from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition(https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting).

Purpose:
Gain insights into Walmart sales for better strategies and optimizations. The dataset includes historical sales data from 45 stores, each with multiple departments, making sales forecasting challenging due to included holiday markdown events.

Steps
1. Data Wrangling: This is the first step where data is inspected to make sure no value is missing or NULL 
   - Build database
  - Create tables

2. Feature Engineering: This will help use generate some new columns from existing ones.
> 1. Add a new column named `time_of_day` to give insight of sales in the Morning, Afternoon and Evening. This will help answer the question on which part of the day most sales are made.

> 2. Add a new column named `day_name` that contains the extracted days of the week on which the given transaction took place (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This will help answer the question on which week of the day each branch is busiest.

> 3. Add a new column named `month_name` that contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar). Help determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.
